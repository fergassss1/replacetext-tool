## what is this?
this is a simple HTML (that means it's a web) that the only purpose it has is to help you change characters on a text.
usage is very simple :D
## why did u make this?
well, it all starts when i discover apple music lyrics. they were incredible, they displayed what the song is saying in real time. later then i discover they are enhanced LRCs. i get an app to get them, i also discover how to make custom eLRCs but theres a problem. i had to remove or change things to actually get them working on my music app. i find a character replacer website, but it has a lot of ads. until now. now, i have my own tool that does that simple function without ads and no servers
## how2 use 
to use this tool, first open up the web at https://fergassss1.github.io/replacetext-tool/ .
second thing, paste or write your text in the text box (the first and biggie one)
after that, just go onto the second text box and put what to find (if you want to grab data that is on (parentheses) or something else type ($data) its marked on the website footer btw)
and to end, put what you want the found characters to convert to and hit replace!

1st project of my new /tool series 

and to end obviously enjoy :P
